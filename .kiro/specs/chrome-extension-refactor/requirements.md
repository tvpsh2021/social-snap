# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project requires refactoring the existing Social Snap Chrome extension to clean up unused code and establish a more flexible, maintainable architecture. The current extension supports downloading images from Threads, Instagram, and Facebook, but the code structure needs optimization to improve maintainability and extensibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and remove unused code so that I can reduce project complexity and maintenance costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing existing code THEN the system SHALL identify all unreferenced functions, variables, and modules
2. WHEN unused code is discovered THEN the system SHALL provide cleanup recommendations and safely remove the code
3. WHEN cleanup is completed THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work properly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish a modular architecture so that I can easily add support for new social media platforms in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the new architecture THEN the system SHALL use clear interface definitions to separate platform-specific implementations
2. WHEN adding a new platform THEN developers SHALL only need to implement platform-specific logic without modifying core code
3. WHEN platform logic changes THEN changes SHALL be isolated within the corresponding platform module

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to refactor the messaging system so that I can improve code readability and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring the messaging system THEN the system SHALL use type-safe message definitions
2. WHEN components communicate THEN message formats SHALL be consistent and easy to understand
3. WHEN handling errors THEN error messages SHALL provide sufficient contextual information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize file structure and naming conventions so that I can improve code readability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reorganizing file structure THEN files and folders SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
2. WHEN viewing project structure THEN developers SHALL be able to quickly understand each module's responsibilities
3. WHEN importing modules THEN import paths SHALL be clear and logical

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish a unified error handling mechanism so that I can improve application stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use a unified error handling strategy
2. WHEN errors are caught THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error information
3. WHEN displaying errors to users THEN error messages SHALL be user-friendly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to refactor the download management functionality so that I can improve download reliability and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading images THEN the system SHALL provide clear download progress feedback
2. WHEN downloads fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms
3. WHEN batch downloading THEN the system SHALL handle large numbers of images without affecting browser performance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the popup interface code structure so that I can improve UI responsiveness and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring popup code THEN UI logic SHALL be separated from business logic
2. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN the interface SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN loading images THEN the interface SHALL display appropriate loading states

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the refactored code maintains backward compatibility so that existing users are not affected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is completed THEN all existing Chrome extension API usage SHALL remain compatible
2. WHEN users upgrade the extension THEN all existing functionality SHALL continue to work properly
3. WHEN stored user settings exist THEN these settings SHALL remain valid after refactoring
