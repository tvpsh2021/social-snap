- Implemented message validation and timeout handling

**Evidence:**
- All inter-component communication uses standardized message types
- Error messages include context, timestamps, and actionable information
- Message bus provides reliable communication with automatic retry logic

### ✅ Requirement 4: File Structure and Naming Optimization

**Completed:**
- Reorganized entire codebase with clear, logical structure
- Implemented consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes)
- Created intuitive folder hierarchy with clear module responsibilities
- Established logical import paths following the new structure
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all public APIs

**Evidence:**
- New file structure in `src/` with clear separation of concerns
- All files follow consistent naming patterns
- Import paths are clear and logical
- Developer can quickly understand module responsibilities

### ✅ Requirement 5: Unified Error Handling

**Completed:**
- Implemented `ErrorHandlerService` for centralized error management
- Created custom `ExtensionError` types with specific error codes
- Established error recovery strategies and user-friendly messages
- Added comprehensive error logging with context tracking
- Implemented error statistics and reporting

**Evidence:**
- All errors flow through `ErrorHandlerService`
- Custom error types provide specific context and recovery options
- User-friendly error messages replace technical error details
- Error logging includes full context for debugging

### ✅ Requirement 6: Download Management Enhancement

**Completed:**
- Refactored `DownloadManagerService` with batch processing capabilities
- Implemented retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Added real-time progress tracking and user feedback
- Created download queue management with concurrency control
- Optimized performance for large batch downloads

**Evidence:**
- Download progress is tracked and displayed in real-time
- Failed downloads automatically retry with intelligent backoff
- Batch downloads handle large numbers of images efficiently
- User receives clear feedback throughout the download process

### ✅ Requirement 7: Popup Interface Optimization

**Completed:**
- Separated UI logic from business logic using `PopupService`
- Created modular UI components (`ImageGridComponent`, `StatusDisplayComponent`, etc.)
- Implemented immediate visual feedback for all user interactions
- Added proper loading states and progress indicators
- Optimized component lifecycle management

**Evidence:**
- Business logic isolated in `PopupService`
- UI components are modular and reusable
- Users receive immediate feedback for all actions
- Loading states provide clear indication of system status

### ✅ Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility

**Completed:**
- Maintained all existing Chrome extension API usage patterns
- Preserved all user-facing functionality and behavior
- Ensured existing user settings remain valid
- Maintained compatibility with Manifest V3 requirements
- Added legacy message handling for smooth transitions

**Evidence:**
- All existing functionality works identically to previous version
- Chrome extension APIs used consistently with previous implementation
- User settings and preferences are preserved
- No breaking changes to user experience

## Architecture Improvements

### Core Services Layer
- **MessageBusService**: Type-safe inter-component communication
- **ErrorHandlerService**: Centralized error handling with recovery strategies
- **LoggingService**: Structured logging with context tracking
- **ConfigurationService**: Centralized configuration management
- **DownloadManagerService**: Enhanced download management with retry logic

### Platform Abstraction Layer
- **BasePlatformExtractor**: Abstract base class enforcing interface contracts
- **PlatformRegistry**: Dynamic platform detection and factory system
- **Platform Extractors**: Specialized implementations for each social media platform

### Service-Oriented Architecture
- Clear separation of concerns across all layers
- Dependency injection for loose coupling
- Interface-based design for extensibility
- Modular components for maintainability

## Code Quality Improvements

### Documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- ✅ Updated README.md with new architecture information
- ✅ Created DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md for extending the platform system
- ✅ Added inline documentation for complex logic

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Optimized DOM queries and async operations
- ✅ Implemented proper cleanup in service destructors
- ✅ Added memory leak prevention for event listeners
- ✅ Optimized batch processing for large downloads

### Code Standards
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions throughout codebase
- ✅ Proper error handling using ErrorHandlerService
- ✅ Structured logging with appropriate levels
- ✅ Type safety through JSDoc annotations

## Testing and Validation

### Functionality Testing
- ✅ All existing features work identically to previous version
- ✅ Image extraction works on all supported platforms
- ✅ Download functionality handles both single and batch operations
- ✅ Error handling provides appropriate user feedback

### Architecture Testing
- ✅ Platform registry correctly detects and creates extractors
- ✅ Message bus handles communication reliably
